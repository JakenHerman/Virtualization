Changes from Monday:
    - Spools Honeypot
    - Python script checks for deltas in the log.txt the gui creates, and creates a trap instance for each change.
    - The trap reads the most recent line from the log.txt file as the received input

    Needed:
        - Need some form of virtual machine check sent from the GUI so the trap can check against the valid user database.
